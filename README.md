# Chrome-Passwords-Recover

This script can decrypt the passwords saved after version 80 of Chrome and won't work for passwords saved in earlier versions.

Do not use this script to steal passwords, it is made to recover yours and only yours.

This script has been inspired from others and updated to work properly under windows 10.
